You can incorporate clauses from the Stonecutters catalog by reference into your contracts and other legal terms.  The easiest and most convenient way to do this is by [permalink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink):

> ## Governing Law
>
> Include <https://stonecutters.law/california-governing-law/1e>.

This ambiguously incorporates the first edition (1e) of the [california-governing-law](/california-governing-law) clause from the Stonecutters catalog by reference.  The [terms](/california-governing-law/1e#terms) of that clause will never change.  If and when we find a way to improve that clause, we will publish a new edition with a different edition number.
